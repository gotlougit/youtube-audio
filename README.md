# Youtube Audio 

This is a fork of [an extension that does the same thing](https://github.com/animeshkundu/youtube-audio) but seems to not be maintained anymore.

The objective is simple; only stream audio on YouTube.

Many people would like to just stream the audio of a particular video, as it is sometimes the main content and playing the video just eats up battery and data.

Right now the extension is only for Firefox, but since WebExtensions is a thing, I plan to make it functional for Chromium-based browsers as well.
