# Youtube Audio 

This is a fork of [an extension that does the same thing](https://github.com/animeshkundu/youtube-audio) but seems to not be maintained anymore. My objective is to do basic housekeeping and use this somewhat mature project as a way to acquaint myself with JavaScript.

The objective is simple; only stream audio on YouTube.

Many people would like to just stream the audio of a particular video, as it is sometimes the main content and playing the video just eats up battery and data.

Right now the extension is only for Firefox, but since WebExtensions is a thing, I plan to make it functional for Chromium-based browsers as well. There's no install page right now since I'd have to make a developer account for publishing to addons.mozilla.org.
